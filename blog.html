      <h2>difference between local storage and session storage</h2>
      <span
        >Ans :sessionStorage is similar to localStorage the difference is that
        while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
        cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
        particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
        assigned to that particular tab.

      <h2>What is difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
      <span
        >Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is
        only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that
        function. Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch
        conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that
        particular condition or loop</span

      <h2>how does javascript event loop work</h2>
      <span
        >The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
        Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the
        first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
        effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event
        Loop.</span
